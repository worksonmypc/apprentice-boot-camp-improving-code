## Zoom etiquette

+ Recording—consent?
+ Have your camera on please
+ If you have a question please speak up
  + If you aren’t confident to interrupt, feel free to put your hand up 
  + Mute in the group sessions, and push space bar to talk 
+ Use Slack chat rather than Zoom chat box
  + Can find stuff later, easier for us to spot

## Feedback from last year

--

## Last year’s apprentices liked…

+ Well paced, fun, interesting exercises and getting to refactor legacy code
+ Mentors helped them feel proud that they could complete exercises
+ Us asking the group what they think the answers are, and starting discussions
+ Clear descriptions of code smells
+ Visualising code
+ Playing with the static analysis
+ Good book references
+ Getting some guidance around peer code review

--

## Last year’s apprentices didn’t like…

+ Code smells exercise didn’t occupy some for the whole time
+ Could have had more colourful illustrations
+ Couldn’t see instructions during refactoring task
+ Not pairing on code smell exercises
+ Ran out of time on code reviews, and reviewed other languages
+ No examples of how the code could be improved
+ Embarrassment about not completing some exercises
+ Not enough stories
