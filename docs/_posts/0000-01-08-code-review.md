## Code Review

+ Another form of feedback
+ *Compliments* automated review
+ Yet another heuristic

Notes: Who has received a review?  
    Who has delivered a review?

    Experiences of code review are not positive

## Code review is critical

+ Great for personal development
+ Important for maintainability
+ Distributes knowledge and consensus
+ Often part of a teams code workflow

--

## When code review goes wrong…

+ Poor work relationships
+ Damaged confidence
+ Low team moral
+ Lack of trust
+ Input shutdown

Note: Important to establish culture of feedback in the team  
    This is a two way street  

--

## Code review done badly

+ Opportunity to demonstrate experience
+ Linting
    + ‘Tabs -> spaces’
    + ‘Indentation is wrong’
+ Bikeshedding
    + Discussing name of a field in a class named `AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean`
+ Contradictory advice
    + ‘But the last review suggested using enums!’

Notes: Leave egos at the door  
    Linting should be done by an automated process  
    Explain bikeshedding  
    Possible to end up in a loop—consistency important  

--

## Empathy

+ Person behind the change
    + People usually don’t set out to write bad code
+ Don’t stamp on their hard work
+ Were they under pressure?
+ Consider your rapport

Notes: Seniority can impact rapport  
    Where is the other developer in their journey?  
    What pressures were they under?

--

## Opportunity to teach

Teaching takes more interaction than a simple comment

Notes: Might need a face-to-face conversation
    Drawing might help
    Consider repetition  

--

## Focus on things that matter

+ Signal / noise ratio important
+ People can only absorb so much

Notes: See further reading for ‘Decisions decisions’ talk about decisions that matter

--

## Good practices
### How to approach

+ Seek to understand the goal
+ Ask less experienced people to review your code
+ Read every line
+ Ask for large changes to be split into smaller chunks
+ Until you know each other, review in person
+ Take breaks every hour
+ Good to deliver reviews as well as receive

--

### What to write

+ Be polite—read what you wrote and imagine being the audience
+ Praise good code (at least once per review)
+ Support rather than criticise
    + Be positive: ‘This might be easier to understand if…’
    + instead of negative: ‘This code is hard to understand’
+ Only comment on new code—check whether they introduced each issue
+ Avoid accusative language ‘why did you…’
+ Include reasoning
+ If nitpicking, be explicit e.g. `nit: this should be lower case`

Notes: Possible to look back beyond commit in GitHub to check if they introduced an issue  

--

## Code review is hard

+ We are generally bad at this
+ Fact: you **will** receive bad reviews
+ Only thing you are in control of is how you react
+ You can make it easier

Notes: arguably as important as how it’s delivered

--

## How to receive a review

+ Seek feedback early
+ Appreciate the time given to you, help by making small changes
+ Drop your ego and don’t be defensive—it’s just code
+ Empathy just as important for you
    + They might not be experienced
    + English might not be their first language
+ Ask if you don’t understand—discussions are good
+ Face time can be much more efficient
+ Check back with the reviewer after addressing changes
    + This should generate some positive comments!

--

## A good code review is

+ Supportive
+ Concise
+ Focused
+ Objective

--

## Recap

+ As with any feedback: timely is better
+ Not too little and not too big
+ Okay to just say ‘LGTM’
+ Code review should focus on things that can’t be automated
+ Important to be kind and consider the person
+ Stick to things that matter
+ Avoid subjectivity

--

## Pairing

+ Review is done collaboratively and implicitly
+ Navigator manages task list rather than interrupting flow
+ Talk about design before doing it
+ Shouldn’t feel like review
+ Shared understanding can make you code blind
+ Can be worth seeking external review

--

## Using GitHub to review code

+ Comment on single commits
+ Create reviews on Pull Requests
+ Request reviews from other contributors
+ Enforce reviews using protected branches
+ See status checks inline with the PR

--

## Commenting on single commit

+ From commit, hover over a line you want to attach a comment to
+ Click blue `+` sign
+ Write the comment, using Markdown
+ Click ‘Add single comment’
+ User is notified

--

## Creating a Pull Request review

See [detailed instructions from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request) for more

+ In the pull request, click ‘Files changed’
+ Hover over a line you want to attach a comment to
+ Click blue `+` sign & write the comment, using Markdown
+ Click ‘Start a review’, then add more comments
+ Click ‘Review changes’ at the top right
+ Summarise & choose whether to ‘Approve’ or ‘Request changes’
+ User is notified

Notes: if finish early, get them to explore protected branches

--

## Exercise: use GitHub to review your neighbours code

+ Need code to be pushed

Notes: Discuss how it felt to receive the review
