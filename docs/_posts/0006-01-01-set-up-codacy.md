## Exercise: Set up Codacy against your fork of the repository

* Work individually
* Visit [www.codacy.com](https://www.codacy.com) and click ‘Get started’
* Authorize Codacy to access your public GitHub repos
* Activate Codacy for your fork
* Wait for it to analyse your code
* Filter to your language and read through the results

Notes: Super easy, but hosted systems are more complex.  
    Was it useful?  
    Did you find anything that you’d missed in the code smell exercise, or reviewing manually?
