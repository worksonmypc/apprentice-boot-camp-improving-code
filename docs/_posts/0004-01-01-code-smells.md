## Code Smells

(but not all code)

--

> If it stinks, change it.
> — Grandma Beck, discussing child-rearing philosophy

— Martin Fowler, [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/refactoring-improving-the/9780134757681/)

+ Things can smell ‘off’ without knowing why: ‘the sniff test’
+ Your sense of smell will improve
  + Important to develop your own intuition
+ Code smells descriptions help in the meantime
  + They are not commandments!

Notes: Everyone has a sense of smell  
Will become more refined  
Can’t always tell what something is  
Can usually tell if it smells good or bad

## Purpose:

### Provide language to discuss problems

+ Less ambiguous if language is shared
+ Takes ego away from conversation
+ Helps you identify issues
+ Suggests resolutions

> A code smell is a hint that something has gone wrong somewhere in your code. Use the smell to track down the problem.
> Note that a CodeSmell is a hint that something might be wrong, not a certainty.

Note: This was the first ever wiki.  
  “The program should express each idea once and only once - there should be no duplicate code.”—OAOO rule  
  Kent also created XP, helped form the Agile Manifesto, is the leading proponent of TDD, spawned unit testing frameworks and popularised CRC cards.  
  OAOO similar to DRY but subtly different

Developed and popularised in Martin Fowler’s book

Note: Martin Fowler built on these ideas in his popular book.

## No single definitive list of smells

You’ll find smells referenced in one list which aren’t described in another 

Notes: Conventions have appeared over the years.  
  You may recognise some of them.

## Upcoming exercise…

+ Explore *some* smells
+ Practice addressing them
